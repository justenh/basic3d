**update**
Basic3D is now hosted at [http://code.google.com/p/justenholter](http://code.google.com/p/justenholter) here you will find the released AS2 classes aswell as the AS3 source.

Basic3D is a simple Actionscript API/Framework for manipulating objects in 3D space. The source is available in both AS2 and AS3. Basic3D is meant to be a light weight positioning system used to move objects within 3D Space. It supports **basic** positioning of objects and cameras within a scene along `x`, `y`, and `z`. Camera rotation is also supported on all three axis however in an attempt to keep the system as lightweight as possible Basic3D does not support object rotation, elements within the scene will always be forward facing elements.
